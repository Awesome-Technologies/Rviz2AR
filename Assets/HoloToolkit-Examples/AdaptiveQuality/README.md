# Adaptive Quality Example
This example shows how to implement an adaptive viewport resolution using AdaptiveQuality and AdaptiveViewport
As you view the particle effects, your gpu cost will increase, causing the quality to drop and the viewport to be resized.
With a smaller viewport you will notice the text getting blocky. Look away from the particles and the quality will get back to normal.
Use a mixed reality headset to try it out.
