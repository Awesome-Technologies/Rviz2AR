### [Solver System](/Assets/HoloToolkit-Examples/Utilities/Readme/README_SolverSystem.md)

At this time, there is no easy, reliable way to specify the update order for Unity components. This can make it difficult to implement deterministic compound transformations. The solver system addresses this issue.
Building on this, Solvers offer a range of follow behaviors (eg tag-along) which can be safely stacked (eg, tag-along + surface magnetism + momentum).
