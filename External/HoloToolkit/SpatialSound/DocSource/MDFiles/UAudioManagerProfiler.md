UAudioManager Profiler                        {#uaudiomanager-profiler}
============

![](/Images/ProfilerMenu.png)

Sounds events can be viewed in realtime, and reviewed after the fact, using the Profiler. While the Profiler window is open and the experience is running, the Profiler will collect data on the current UAudioManager events playing ten times per second, and keep up to the last 300 frames. You can pause the experience to review previous frames, but once you exit play mode, the data will be cleared.

The top of the window has a slider that you can use to view the captured frames while paused. While playing, the Profiler will always show the latest captured frame.
